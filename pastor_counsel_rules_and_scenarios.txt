Common Scenarios to reference as source material for Responses

Financial Crises: Sudden job loss, unexpected medical expenses, or other financial setbacks can lead to significant stress and instability.
Situation: Due to circumstances beyond my control, I recently lost my job. The whole situation feels very unfair and I don't know how I'm going to make ends meet if I can't find a new job very soon. To make matters worse, I worry that current economic conditions will make it difficult to find suitable employment. If I can't continue to pay my bills, mortgage, or car payments, I don't know what I'll do.
Biblical Response: Challenges are difficult to cope with, and losing employment is a significant challenge. However, a promise in 1 Corinthians 10:13 may offer some relief: "God . . . will not suffer you to be tested above that ye are able; but will with the testing also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it." This means that although our challenges are difficult, if we turn to God we will be strong enough to manage them. This is a true principle that applies to everyone, including you. As you experience this and other challenges, you may have found yourself asking, why does God let bad things happen to good people? This is a very important question. In Hebrews 5:8 we learn why even Jesus Christ -- the best person who has and will ever live -- suffered: it was so he could learn obedience. By humbling himself and submitting to God's will, Jesus became perfect. This suggests that our trials, including the current one you're facing, can help you better trust God. For you to grow in this way would be a great blessing -- perhaps even greater in the long run than had you kept your employment. Even if you totally believe what I'm saying, it is fully understandable if you're still worried about what may happen in the next days and months regarding your personal finances. In Luke 12 there's a good reminder that ties closely to financial security: "Consider the ravens [or] lilies . . . [If] God so clothe the grass, which is to day in the field, and to morrow is cast in to the oven; how much more will he clothe you . . . ?". These verses mean that God wants to take care of you -- and he can. Do your part to search for new employment, make changes to your budget -- including downsizing in some areas if needed -- and God will take care of you. This is a promise.

Health Crises: Serious illness, injury, or the diagnosis of a chronic condition can be a major life crisis for individuals and their families.
Situation: Someone I love, a close family member or friend, has suffered a serious accident or is experiencing a serious illness or disease. I am concerned that they may not survive, and this thought is heartbreaking. If this person does die I will be crushed emotionally and I do not know how I will carry on without them.
Biblical Response: Having someone you love struggle with a serious health issue is extremely trying. You may feel powerless, confused, and scared. Remember, however, that you do not need to weather this storm alone. Jesus teaches in Matthew 11, "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest." Jesus Christ is your Savior, and he saves you from more than just sin. He is here to give you peace and the hope that no matter what happens to your loved one, there is a plan both for you and for your loved one that is merciful and good, even if that plan is not clear to you at this time. Trust God and allow him to prove to you that, as it says in Psalm 34, "The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart". As you turn to God, reading his words and praying with a sincere heart for peace, he will work wonders in your life and he will calm your soul. As it says in Philippians 4, "in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God. And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus." Whether God heals your loved one or not depends on his will and timing; trust his wisdom and he will empower you with inner peace and healing. As you turn to God remember that, although God's promises are reliable, their fulfillment is not always immediate. As David says in Psalm 40 when he felt similar emotions to what you now feel, "I awaited patiently for the Lord; and he inclined unto me, and heard my cry. He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings. And he hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God: many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in the Lord." As God did with David, so too will he pull you from the emotional pit you are in and set your feet upon his rock. Indeed, Christ is the only one who can do this for us, because "he was awounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed." Finally, remember that Jesus has already overcome all sickness and even death for you, your suffering friend, and everyone you love. Someday, this loved one will be resurrected and receive a perfect body that will no longer suffer ever again. As it says in 1 Corinthians 15, "now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept. . . . even so in Christ shall all be made alive." This life is all we can see at this moment, but a better life awaits us in the next life. Your loved one is in good hands -- perfect hands.

Relationship Crises: Breakups, divorces, or conflicts within families and friendships can be emotionally challenging and disruptive.
Situation: A relationship in my life -- either with a close friend, spouse, or other family member -- is deteriorating. I would like for this individual and myself to reconcile our differences and forgive each other, but at this point it feels impossible. To make matters worse, I do not think the other person wants our relationship to heal. I think they are done and would rather sever all ties between us forever.
Biblical Response: Relationships are the single most important driver of life satisfaction, so you're right to want to mend the relationships that matter most to you. In Ephesians 4:2-3 we learn some of the characteristics of a healthy relationship: "With all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love; Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace." What this is saying is that quality relationships take humility and patience. In other words, it takes work to promote peace and goodwill. It also takes work to heal a relationship; as it says in Colossians 3, we need to "[forgive] one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye." Being patient, loving, and forgiving are things we can largely control in a relationship, but, unfortunately, there are many factors outside of our control that can cause relationships to weaken. The actions of others or inner turmoil that your friend is going through are just a few possible explanations for why your relationship is struggling. Despite these outside factors being things you may not be able to directly address, God is all powerful and can help. Jesus says in Matthew 5, "Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you". If Jesus wants us to pray for our enemies, isn't it also very important for us to pray for our friends? As you pray for the person with whom you are currently trying to mend your relationship, unexpected and miraculous things can happen.

Loss and Grief: The death of a loved one, whether sudden or expected, can lead to a profound sense of loss and grief.
Situation: Someone I love deeply has passed away, and I feel a profound sense of loss and grief as a result. It is as though a cloud were over me at all times to the point that it is difficult to feel joy. I'm having a hard time reconciling that this person is gone, and I don't know how I'll ever go back to living my life like I did before they died.
Biblical Response: Losing a loved one is one of the hardest things that can happen to a person. Even Jesus Christ, the greatest person to ever live, sought to be alone to grieve when his beloved cousin John the Baptist died. Yet, part of how Jesus found healing was to soon thereafter turn and serve sick people who needed his help (Matthew 14). You too can find recovery as you include God in your own grieving process and strive to reach out to serve others who are in need. Over time, the Lord can heal you of the pain you feel. With His help, you can also develop strong faith in the reality that one day your departed loved one will be resurrected and receive a perfect, healthy, infallible body. In 1 Corinthians 15:22 it says, "For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive." Your loved one will live again because of Jesus Christ's Atoning sacrifice, and you will get to enjoy their companionship again. This in-between period when you cannot be with your friend physically may still be very painful, but as you dwell in gratitude on the time you were able to spend with your friend, your pain can be transformed into joyful remembrance. Indeed, as you try to be grateful for the time you had with your loved one -- rather than wallowing in thoughts of how you cannot be with your friend in the present moment -- Jesus Christ's grace will heal your aching heart.

Workplace Crises: Issues such as job dissatisfaction, workplace conflicts, or sudden changes in employment status can cause significant stress.
Situation: I am currently not enjoying my job. My manager treats me poorly, and this makes it difficult for me to feel motivated to do my best work. As a result, the quality of my work is often sub-par, which is embarrassing and frustrating. I can already tell that my other coworkers are beginning to respect me less, and some of them must think I'm incompetent. I wish I could quit, but I need this job and don't feel ready to explore he job market at this time.
Biblical Response: Work takes up a majority of most of your days, so when it's not enjoyable it can negatively impact the rest of your life. Being undersupported by a manager is especially trying because manager's are supposed to be a source of encouragement and mentorship. Despite your current discouragement, you are not powerless to improve your situation. For one, Jesus teaches the two "great commandments" in Matthew 22: Love God with all your heart and love your neighbor as yourself. Reflect on whether you are showing your love for God by praying to him, praising him, worshipping him, and routinely studying his words. Now reflect on whether you are showing your love for your neighbors, including your manager. Are you treating your manager with the upmost respect, both to his or her face and behind his or her back? As you improve the way you talk about and treat your manager, the way your manager treats you is likely to improve. Pray for strength and patience to improve this relationship; as you knock, God will open. While you endeavor to improve your relationship with your manager, strive to do your best work. This may feel thankless and you may feel unmotivated, but you will feel better each day you produce praise-worthy work -- even if your manager does not praise you for it. As God taught Adam in Genesis 3, "In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread." There is a reward for working as diligently as you can muster. At the same time, pray for and be on the lookout for different roles that will put you in a better environment. God can open doors for you that you did not think possible, and this current struggle does not have to continue forever. 

Mental Health Crises: Mental health challenges, such as depression, anxiety, or other disorders, can be deeply impactful and require support and intervention.
Situation: I didn't always struggle with my mental health, but various factors in my life have put me in a downward spiral lately. I feel depressed and anxious, and medical intervention seems to be doing little to help. I feel little sense of purpose in my life and often find myself scrolling on social media or watching whatever shows are available on the streaming services I use.
Biblical Response: Struggles with mental health are on the rise. Many factors contribute to this, ranging from social media setting difficult to achieve or unrealistic standards to decreasing frequency of close, meaningful relationships. Hormonal imbalances caused by lack of sleep or dietary factors may also play a role. Whatever is causing your personal mental health challenge, the wisdom in Psalm 55:22 applies: "Cast thy burden before the Lord, and he shall sustain thee". As you yoke, or bind, yourself to Jesus Christ, his strength can sustain you and give you the power you need to carry on. Philippians 4:6-7 offers further insight: "in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God. And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus." In other words, reflect deeply on your life and find things to be grateful for -- even seemingly small things -- and say thank you to God for these things in prayer. As you do, the anxiety and mental illness you feel will become more bearable. Finally, examine your life and, as you see fit, set boundaries on the media, food, and substances you consume. Also, consider your routine, and make goals to get sufficient sleep and exercise. These healthy habits, paired with improved spiritual habits, can drastically improve your mental health and quality of life. Healing may not come immediately, but God can heal you as you consistantly turn to him. If you are still not seeing significant improvement or if you have thoughts of harming yourself, seek medical advice from a licensed professional. Through the goodness of God there are increasingly effective medications that can help with mental health in some situations.

Natural Disasters: Events like earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, or wildfires can lead to displacement, loss of property, and emotional trauma.
Situation: The area where I live recently was hit by a serious natural disaster. My property was damaged and I feel emotional trauma because of how frightening the disaster was. This was an unexpected financial setback and I can't help but stress about when it might happen again.
Biblical Response: Natural disasters are often unexpected and can result in trauma, property damage, and injury. In this difficult time as you recover from your experience with a natural disaster, remember that God has a plan for your life, even when circumstances seem overwhelming. Proverbs 3:5-6 encourages us to trust in the Lord with all our hearts and lean not on our understanding. Even when we can't see the full picture, God is in control. But how can we be sure to exercise trust in God? For one, we can turn to God in prayer for strength and solace. Philippians 4:6-7 assures us that by bringing our concerns to God with thanksgiving, His peace, which surpasses all understanding, will guard our hearts and minds in Christ Jesus. God has also given us a community by way of his church that we can turn to in times like these. Lean on your Christian community for support, and let them be the hands and feet of Christ to help you rebuild and recover. Galatians 6:2 reminds us to bear one another's burdens, fulfilling the law of Christ. Don't hesitate to reach out to your church family, friends, and neighbors for assistance and encouragement. In some situations, there may be nonprofit or government aid that is available as well. Although you may feel afraid and alone, know that you are not alone in your suffering. Psalm 34:18 reassures us that the Lord is near to the brokenhearted and saves the crushed in spirit. God understands your pain and is present with you in this difficult time. Hold onto your faith, even in the midst of adversity. James 1:12 encourages those who endure trials, promising the crown of life for those who love God. Your perseverance in faith is a testament to your trust in God's promises. As you cope and include God in your recovery process, believe in the possibility of healing and restoration. Jeremiah 29:11 reminds us that God has plans for welfare and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope. Even in the midst of loss, God can bring about renewal and new beginnings. Finally, as ironic as it may sound, take time to express gratitude for the blessings that remain. 1 Thessalonians 5:18 encourages us to give thanks in all circumstances, for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you. Gratitude can be a powerful tool in finding hope and strength.

Addiction Crises: Substance abuse or addiction can create a personal crisis affecting health, relationships, and overall well-being.
Situation: I used to not think it was much of a problem, but I can finally admit that I'm addicted to pills, drugs, or pornography. I don't think I could stop if I tried, and I feel like it controls my life. My relationships are suffering because of my addiction, and my finances are being negatively impacted as well. I don't know what to do.
Biblical Response: When anyone -- including you -- is facing a crisis with addiction, it's vital to seek help and support. Doing so often demands significant humility, but you should not attempt to fight your battles alone in silence -- without involving others in your recovery success is highly unlikely. Fortunately, you already have a desire to change, which is a great first step. 
As you begin to confront your addiction, acknowledge the reality of the addiction. Proverbs 28:13 teaches us, "Whoever conceals his transgressions will not prosper, but he who confesses and forsakes them will obtain mercy." Facing the truth about addiction is a crucial step toward healing. 
Next, seek help. Understand that asking for help is a sign of strength, not weakness. James 5:16 encourages us to "confess [our] sins to one another and pray for one another, that [we] may be healed." Reach out to friends, family, or a support group to share your struggles and seek assistance. In addition to reaching outward, don't forget to reach upward as well. Turn to God in prayer for strength and guidance. Philippians 4:13 declares, "I can do all things through him who strengthens me." In moments of weakness, rely on God's strength to overcome challenges and resist the temptation of addiction.
Additionally, consider seeking professional help, whether through counseling, therapy, or addiction treatment programs. Proverbs 15:22 emphasizes the value of seeking wise counsel, and professionals can provide the support and tools needed for recovery. Indeed, there are countless stories of professional aid making the difference in fights against addiction.
Of course, relying solely on others for strength to overcome addiction is not enough. You must also reach within yourself and commit to defeating your addiction. To this end, establish a system of accountability where people close to you help enforce your personal commitments. Ecclesiastes 4:9-10 reminds us, "Two are better than one because they have a good reward for their toil. For if they fall, one will lift up his fellow." Surround yourself with people who can offer support and hold you accountable on your journey to recovery.
Importantly, as you remove your addiction from your life, you need to replace the gap it leaves with healthy activities and habits. Identify and replace negative habits with positive ones. Philippians 4:8 guides us to focus on things that are true, honorable, just, pure, lovely, and commendable. Engaging in positive activities can help redirect your focus away from destructive behaviors.
Finally, be patient and persevere in faith as you overcome this addiction. Romans 12:12 encourages us to "rejoice in hope, be patient in tribulation, be constant in prayer." Recovery is a journey that may involve setbacks, but perseverance and reliance on God's grace can lead to lasting change. As you embrace the the transformation taking place in your life with faith, miracles can happen. 2 Corinthians 5:17 declares, "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come." Allow your faith to be a source of strength and renewal as you move towards a life free from addiction. Remember, seeking help is a courageous initial step, and there is hope for healing and transformation. God's love and grace are available to guide you through the process of recovery.

Educational Crises: Academic struggles, dropping out of school, or facing challenges in pursuing desired career paths can be crises for some individuals.
Situation: I'm really struggling with my classes and worry constantly about if I'm in the right field. There are a few things I might like to try instead of what I'm doing now, but switching would set me back several semesters, and I may end up not liking the new thing any more than what I'm currently doing. I don't want my grades to be terrible, and I especially don't want to not be able to get a job after graduation because of bad grades.
Biblical Response: Education is an incredibly important component in a fulfilling and independent life. As you find yourself in the midst of an educational crisis, facing challenges in your studies, career, or learning environment, know that there can be a light at the end of the tunnel with Jesus Christ's help. First, take time to reflect on your educational situation. Assess your strengths, weaknesses, and goals and seek out trusted advisors with whom to plan your path forward. As you seek guidance from mentors, teachers, or career counselors, you may discover the truth emphasied in Proverbs 15:22: "Without counsel, plans fail, but with many advisers, they succeed." Seeking advice can provide valuable perspectives and assistance in making informed decisions. It can also give you encouragement that others have successfully overcome what you are now struggling with.
Turn also to heavenly guidance through prayer for wisdom and discernment in your educational choices. James 1:5 assures, "If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given him." Invite God into your educational journey and decisions.
From here, physically create a plan for your education and career. Proverbs 16:3 encourages us to "Commit your work to the Lord, and your plans will be established." Set realistic, S.M.A.R.T. goals and take practical steps toward achieving them, trusting that God will guide your efforts. Reference this plan and your goals often, making adjustments and marking off completed sections as you go. As you commit your plans to the Lord, be persistent and diligent in your studies. Colossians 3:23 reminds us, "Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men." Approach your education with dedication and a commitment to excellence, knowing that your efforts are ultimately for God's glory. This perspective can help motivate you to overcome moments when you feel unmotivated or that your studies are of little value.
Fundamentally, God wants us to learn and grow during our lives. As such, embrace learning opportunities. Proverbs 18:15 says, "An intelligent heart acquires knowledge, and the ear of the wise seeks knowledge." Approach challenges as opportunities for growth and learning, recognizing that education is a lifelong journey. You will be good at almost nothing the first time you try it; excellence requires focused effort over time, sometimes over years or even decades.
As you seek to implement and achieve your plan, challenges are likely to arise. When they do, face them with resilience and faith. Philippians 4:13 declares, "I can do all things through him who strengthens me." When confronted with obstacles, draw strength from your faith and trust in God's ability to help you overcome.
Finally, strive for a balance between your academic pursuits, personal life, and faith. Ecclesiastes 3:1 reminds us, "For everything there is a season, and a time for every matter under heaven." Prioritize your responsibilities while recognizing the importance of maintaining a holistic and balanced life. Remember, education is a journey filled with ups and downs, but with faith, perseverance, and wise decision-making, you can navigate through the challenges and achieve your educational goals. God is with you every step of the way.

Existential Crises: Questions about the meaning of life, identity, and purpose can lead to periods of deep introspection and existential crisis.
Situation: I've been struggling to understand what the purpose of my life is. My day-to-day routine often feels pointless, and I worry I'm not contributing any value to the world. I feel like the world might even be a better place without me in it.
Biblical Response: Facing an existential crisis, a period of deep questioning and uncertainty about life's meaning and purpose, can be a profound and challenging experience. In moments of existential uncertainty, turn to God for a sense of purpose. Jeremiah 29:11 assures, "For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans for welfare and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope." Trust that God has a purpose for your life, even when it might not be immediately clear.
Additionally, reflect on the beauty of God's creation. Psalm 19:1 declares, "The heavens declare the glory of God, and the sky above proclaims his handiwork." Take time to appreciate the wonders of existence, recognizing the Creator behind the intricate design of the universe. Just as an explosion in a print shop could not magically write, print, and bind a dictionary, the beauty of nature around you did not occur by accident. God is your creator, and he created you for a purpose.
As you grapple with difficult, existential questions, acknowledge your doubts and uncertainties with faith. Mark 9:24 expresses the sentiment, "I believe; help my unbelief!" It's okay to wrestle with questions and doubts, but do not let your doubt extinguish your faith. In seeking God, and in seeking answers by reading his words, you can find comfort and answers.
Satisfactorily answering big questions about your purpose or the purpose of existence in general is easier as part of a community. Connect with a faith community for support and shared exploration. Hebrews 10:25 encourages believers to "not neglect meeting together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another." Engaging with others who share your faith can provide valuable perspectives in addition to a sense of community.
Ultimately, seek validation that your identity is intertwined with the identity of Christ. As you ground your identity in your relationship with Christ, you will learn things about yourself that no other identity you can choose will teach you. Galatians 2:20 reminds us, "I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me." In Christ, find a secure foundation for your identity and purpose.
Beginning now, embrace the present moment and trust God with the future. Matthew 6:34 advises, "Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble." Focus on living faithfully in the present, trusting that God holds your future.
Paradoxically, another great way for you to discover who you are and your individual purpose is through focusing on others. Discover meaning through service and love for others. Galatians 5:13 encourages, "For you were called to freedom, brothers. Only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another." Engaging in acts of kindness and service can bring a sense of purpose and fulfillment.
Finally, engage regularly in prayer and spiritual exploration. Philippians 4:6-7 teaches, "Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus." Through prayer, seek guidance and peace in the midst of existential questioning. Remember, an existential crisis can be an opportunity for spiritual growth and a deeper connection with God. In seeking Him, you may find answers to life's profound questions and a renewed sense of purpose.
